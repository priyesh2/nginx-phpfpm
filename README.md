# an example Dockerfile for Nginx with PHP-FPM, along with the necessary configuration files:

Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

FROM nginx:latest: This sets the base image to use as a parent. In this case, we're using the latest version of the official Nginx image.

WORKDIR /var/www/html: This sets the working directory to /var/www/html, which is where the web files will be stored.

RUN apt-get update && \ apt-get install -y php-fpm php-mysql && \ apt-get clean && \ rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*: This installs PHP and other required packages, cleans 

up the package manager's cache, and removes any unneeded files.

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf: This copies the Nginx configuration file from the local machine to the container.

COPY php-fpm.conf /etc/php/7.4/fpm/php-fpm.conf: This copies the PHP-FPM configuration file from the local machine to the container.

COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf: This copies the default Nginx site configuration file from the local machine to the container.

COPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php: This copies an example index.php file to the web directory.

EXPOSE 80: This exposes port 80, which is the default HTTP port for Nginx.

CMD service php7.4-fpm start && nginx -g "daemon off;": This starts the PHP-FPM and Nginx services when the container is started
